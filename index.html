<h1> Differences Ch8 and Ch7 <h1>
<p> Previously discussed in Chapter 7, the data was represented in histograms or plots. Therefore it could be interpreted using mean, mode, standard deviation, and range. However, in Chapter 8 the data being delt with is different, for instance, the data is continuous. In result, the data must be represented by time series charts. An Average is taken of the data instead of mean or median, and the averages can be plotted. These charts better visualize data that shows a rate of change for the audience.
</p>
<h1> Pros  </h1>
<ol>
  <li> Subseries Charts can be used to compare data side by side inside the same visualization so that the audience can make more understanding deductions of the data trends </li>
  <li> Indexes demonstrate a trend in the data which can be easily obeserved </li>
  <li> Log transformation increases the values inputed by 10. Therefore, the data can be visualized and understood without the effect of a sudden exponential curve. </li>
  </ol>
  
  <h1> Cons </h1>
  <ol>
  <li> Logarithmic scale can be a con, in the sense where when the data is plotted, the audience cannot understand the curve and may only see an exponential curve or spike. </li>
  <li> Time series charts show a deceptive visualization, where the needed in depth information, detail or depth, is not given. </li>
  <li> Mix effects can cause a skew the data or manipulation, and are affected by subpopulations within the data </li>
  </ol>
